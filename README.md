## Papers
- [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf): The original 9 page paper by Satoshi Nakamoto.

- [Ethereum Whitepaper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/): This introductory paper was originally published in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, before the project's launch in 2015. It's worth noting that Ethereum, like many community-driven, open-source software projects, has evolved since its initial inception.

## Explainers
- [Official Ethereum Guide](https://ethereum.org/en/learn/) While several years old, we maintain this paper because it continues to serve as a useful reference and an accurate representation of Ethereum and its vision. To learn about the latest developments of Ethereum, and how changes to the protocol are made, we recommend this guide.
